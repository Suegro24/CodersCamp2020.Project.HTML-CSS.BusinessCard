## About project
Project was created and developed as a part of CodersCamp course. The main goal was to show the skills related to basics of web development.

## Technologies
* HTML5
* SASS

## Features
The website contains five sections describing the author, his skills, experience and contact informations. A web page is responsive and compatible with RWD standards. SASS code was compiled to CSS with use of gulp.js. 

## Inspiration
Section named "skills" was based on [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/shots/4894403-Product-info-hover)

## Status
Page is currently in version 1.0.0. There are planned fixes in the near future based on users feedback. Moreover, I would like to add JavaScript to liven up website.

## License
Project was distributed under the MIT License. See [License](./LICENSE) for more information.

## Author
Code was created by [Dominik Puchała](https://github.com/Suegro24)
